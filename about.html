	<h2>What is The Weird Girls Project?</h2>
	
	<p>The Weird Girls Project is an ongoing art experiment created and produced concept artist Kitty Von-Sometime. It evolves ‘Episode’ by ‘Episode’ and the participants mix between those involved from the beginning and new members increasing with every event. Each Episode is planned for approximately three months with the participants knowing as little as is possible about the event excluding the date, this includes the concept, location and costumes. As standard there will be a photo shoot and they are aware they will be filmed. The main element of the project is ‘release to the unknown’.</p>

<p>Media is produced from each Episode but the project also focuses on the event itself and how the women react, improvise and morph within costume learning about their power of self combined with the strength of coming together as a group. The women are varying in ages, backgrounds and experience, and do not necessarily know each other before the day. The Project involves ordinary women rather than professional actresses or models and part of the inspiration was to encourage a gain in self confidence within women, especially focusing around body issues and a release of inhibitions.</p>

<p>It started in a very naive style with the end media showing little to no experience and it has matured throughout the life of the project. Kitty creates the concept for each event and in addition has directed, designed and edited on varying Episodes but always draws in the talents of different photographers, costume makers and film makers to bring the concept to life forming a constantly fluid collaborative.</p>

<b><p>Artist Statement:</b></p>

<p>I take what is in my head and make it real. I am a child born of the emerging digital world and have a continual hunger to record what I do compulsively in digital form. My existence is a drop in the ocean, the documentation forms the ripples.</p>

<p>My inspiration comes from childhood dreams, from synchronicity, from freeing those from their own constraints and a personal obsession with spandex. I proactively involve those outside of art to become art, to live art, to feel art. Those who are entangled in what I do, what I make, are often completely unknown to me before we merge ourselves together.</p>

<p>Undercurrents of female empowerment run deep, specifically with regard to the female form but come secondary to creating visual imagery that envelops the viewer in a candyland, making their mouths water - summoning without them knowing why there is a sudden desire to come out to play.</p>

<p>I have not studied art and am unaware what is standard. 
The more I create the more I want to.</p>
